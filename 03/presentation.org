* Basics
** Neural Network
   A neural network is a massively parallel distributed processor made up of simple
   processing units that has a natural propensity for storing experiential knowledge
   and making it available for use. It resembles the brain in two respects:
   1. Knowledge is acquired by the network from its environment through a learning process.
   2. Inter-neuron connection strengths, known as synaptic weights, are used to store
      the acquired knowledge.
** Learning Processes
   1. Supervised learning
   2. Unsupervised learning
   3. Reinforcement learning

** TensorFlow
   TensorFlow is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation.
   Its flexible architecture allows easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms
   (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge devices.
** Keras
   Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow,
   CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.
   Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

** Gym
   Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.
   It supports teaching agents everything from walking to playing games like Pong or Pinball.
